# Robb's Portfolio/Resume Template 

This is a simple one page personal portfolio website. The styling has been separated out from the content, which means one could easily [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), clone it locally, then replace the contents of the [constants.js](https://github.com/robbwdoering/portfolio/blob/main/src/constants.js) file.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so it can be run with `npm run start`, and built with `npm run build`.
